# Terminal-style web page

You can simply fork or copy this repo to setup your own terminal style page. To customize the text, simply edit <a href="https://github.com/LJStroemsdoerfer/nerdy-page/blob/main/assets/text/welcome.txt">welcome.txt</a>. You can also add a custom background image by changing <a href="https://github.com/LJStroemsdoerfer/nerdy-page/blob/main/assets/img/background.png">background.png</a>.

The design comes from <a href="https://codenerve.github.io">CodeNerve</a>. I simply switched it up a bit and added a workflow to deploy it to GitHub pages. This makes it easier to host your very own webpage at ease.
